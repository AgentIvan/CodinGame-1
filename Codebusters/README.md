CodinGame
=========

My submission for the AI CodinGame contest [CodeBusters](https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished).

My bot finished 58th from over 1500 submissions (see the [final leaderboard](https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/global/challenge/codebusters)).

No time for nice programming, the code style is really bad, many unused code parts ... but with some comments :-).
